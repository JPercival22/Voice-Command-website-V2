                        <p>When you have had enough practice in keeping time, you might find that adding a downward
                            strum to every beat becomes a little tedious, more often than not, songs tend to add half
                            beats between main beats and this is were the upwards strum come's into play. So far we have
                            worked out that we count in 4 second beats and for each beat we strum downwards.
                            The extra beat usually follows the third beat and can be tricky to master especially with
                            chord changes. One way to overcome this is to count out loud at first, " 1, 2, 3, and 4."
                            Saying the word, "and, " will remind you to include the upwards strum.<br><b> For all voice

                            You should by now have learned how to hold the guitar, where to position your fingers whilst
                            playing a chord and hopefully how to strum in time too. So now is the time to learn a basic
                            song to start you playing the Rhythm guitar.

                            One of the most influential artist of all times, is Jimmy Hendrix. In addition to playing
                            with his teeth, behind his back, or without touching the instrumentâ€™s strings, he also
                            played his guitar upside down, although there was a very simple reason for that, he was
                            left-handed. Most of his songs were created using the Power Chord. His version of, "All
                            Along the Watchtower," is hailed as a masterpiece, using just one of the Power Chords from
                            this tutorial and a strum pattern already explained, its time for a lesson.</p>
                        <div class="chord-section1">
                            <h2>The Chords</h2>

                            <p>
                                This Power Chord was explained in a previous section of this web site, it is the
                                simplest chord to learn and with enough practice will power drive your way into
                                mastering this song and many more to come too! The chord diagram on the left explains
                                clearly were you should place your finger tips and also, if you remember from a previous
                                tutorial, which fingers tips go where.<br> Don't worry if you have forgotten which
                                number belongs to which finger, the hand diagram, displayed lower, clearly identifies
                                where each finger goes with its respectful number. On the chord diagram the dots
                                represent where you should fret the board along with each corresponding finger number.

                                The Power Chord above is called the F-Power Chord and the actual shape will not change
                                all of the way through this song, sometimes keeping it simple is the best way to learn
                                anything in life. Practice this chord before starting the lesson, sometimes a beginner
                                may not be fretting the string hard enough, the easiest way to find out if you are
                                playing it correctly is simply by listening. Play each string with your plectrum, is
                                each string playing the right sound?
                                If you find that some or even all of the strings are making the wrong sound, for
                                example, a slight buzzing sound or if the sound is muted then press harder on the
                                strings and repeat until each string sounds correct.<br>Once you are confident in
                                playing this chord on different frets, each note is sounding as it should then you are
                                ready for the lesson.</p>

                            <p>
                                The chords for this song are the same all of the way through, except they're on
                                different frets.<br>It is worth remembering that a beat is 1 downwards strum every
                                second. The first being on the 9th fret for 4 beats (4 down strums), then the 7th fret
                                for 2 beats (2 down strums), up to the 5th fret for 4 beats then back onto the 7th fret
                                for 4 beats - that's it!<br> A really simple song with a powerful sound. Below is a
                                table which explains things better, giving the chord name, the fret number and what each
                                chord is called - just using the chord shown above.
                                <br>It will take a lot of practice, if you are a complete beginner be sure to expect
                                some wrist pain and your finger tip's becoming dry and sore-this is completely normal
                                and it will disappear after a week or two of playing your guitar. Remember that you are
                                making wrist and hand movements you have never done before, it will pass after a short
                                while, remember to rest when you need to and keep practicing. <br>Sometimes you will
                                want to quit playing the guitar, but if you don't - Then you will surely be rewarded</p>

                        <h2>Beats</h2>
                        Beats can help measure tempos and are performed in grooves and rhythmic music. They measure the
                        pulse and rhythm of a musical piece. They are usually divided into two kinds: stressed and
                        unstressed. Stressed beats are the 'strong' beats and unstressed are the 'weak' beats.
