# Voice-Command-website-V2
This is an updated version of my University dissertation to measure the feasibility of using a non AI, rules based, voice command system to navigate a website. 
Generally cleaning up the code and adding and improving elements following a survey.

After conducting some User Testing, Surveys and some Dev UAT, the following issues were found and a solution was concluded: 

(1)It was discovered that some devices had some styling issues, further investigation found that this was because CSS Grid was not available for those devices.
Following on from this, a solution was made to change the styling of the whole site from CSS Grid over to Flex.
This meant redesigning and accommodating some elements of the pages into components and thus reducing the code in the process.

(2)The Survey found that the Voice Command Modal was hard to follow, so the text was reduced, color was found to be an issue and following some User Testing, it
was found the users wanted a more neutral color throughout for this component, with the background blurred to highlight the hierarchy of the modal. A decision was made to make the background clickable as well as the modal accessible to all users not just to those using the voice command.

(3)The Users' tested, suggested cutting down on the Academic language, to increase the readability for the lower skilled students, this was understood and carried out.

(4)It was suggested that videos would be useful, this will be a future implementation to the site.

(5)As a point of interest to the user, it was decided to include a strip banner underneath the new and improved top navigation area to transpose the user, once clicked, to
another site which showcases the thought process and design of the site.

(6)It was inferred that the site lacked branding colors and an added color swatch was included.

(7)Some users made strong suggestions to include a varied number of inclusions from several bands and songs to learn too. Further investigation's concluded, it was discovered that many sites do this and there is no concern over copyright infringements to do so. Pages were designed, tested and developed to accommodate this.
