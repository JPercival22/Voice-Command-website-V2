            <h1>Finger Positioning</h1>
            <p>Playing the guitar can be a very rewarding, healthy and a satisfying skill. It can never be mastered,
              there is always something new to learn. Once a guitarist learns how to hold a guitar properly, the next
              step is learning finger posture and positioning. Posture is important in all aspects of life, such as
              sitting in your chair or standing for example. If your posture is right then you will perform to the best
              of your ability, its pretty simple, if your postures good - you play good.<br> One way of retaining all of
              these skills is by learning the numbers of each finger rather than their names. More on that later, for
              now we'll just look into how to start.<br><b> For all voice commands for this website, just say, "What to
                say" at any time to open the Help Box.</b><br>

            <h4> You are going to be moving your fingers into new positions playing the guitar, a good technique is
              before and whilst playing the guitar to stretch your fingers across and off the fretboard, this stops your
              finger's and wrist's from cramping too.

            <p>The is a chord diagram. The vertical lines are the strings. The horizontal lines are the metal strips
              going across your fretboard, these are called frets.<br> The black dots represent were to place your
              fingers to play the chord. This chord is called E-minor, the numbers within these dots represent which
              finger to use.<br> Each number represents a finger, the Index finger in number 1, the Middle is number 2,
              the Ring finger is number 4 and your little finger is number 4. Occasionally you will use your thumb,
              because it is not a finger, it is labelled simply with the letter, "T."

            <p>
              Posture is important in all aspects of life, such as sitting in your chair or standing for example. If
              your posture is right then you will perform to the best of your ability, its a pretty simple concept, if
              your postures good - you play good.<br>With finger posture, especially on a stringed instrument such as a
              guitar, it is important to get the balance right between placement of the finger pads on the strings
              (position) and arching of the wrist and knuckles. Before playing a chord stretch your fingers as wide as
              they can and back again. Move around the fretboard alternating between chords and find which posture is
              most comfortable for you and efficient in terms of reaching for your next chord.

            <p>A guitar chord is made up of two or more notes, played on a guitar at one time. Chord changes, that is
              the choice of individual notes in the chord, can be changed for many different purposes and playing
              styles.</p>
